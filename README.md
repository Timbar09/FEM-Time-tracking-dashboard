## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

In this project, I didn't acquire any new knowledge or skills. However, it offered me a valuable opportunity to apply my existing skills and demonstrate my attention to detail. It allowed me to bring a design template to life with precise accuracy, showcasing my ability to faithfully execute a given design.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I am eager to delve into React further, particularly those that involve a substantial number of components. This will enable me to explore concepts and technologies such as Redux Toolkit and REST APIs. I am excited to expand my skills and knowledge in these areas through practical application and hands-on experience.

### Useful resources

- [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs) - The official documentation for React provided comprehensive information on the React library, its concepts, and how to use it effectively.

- [ChatGPT](https://www.example.com) - This helped me in understanding or breaking down some of the concepts that I have been using but did not fully gasp.
